# go through directories and

cat pass/*.fastq.gz >> central_location/species.fastq.gz
  # concatenate pass fastq file and put them into one file

# once all files are in the central location species.fastq.gz

module load seqtk

# this will then be your input for TE_prediction_single.sh

#once you are happy you can remove central_location/species.fastq.gz to save memory
